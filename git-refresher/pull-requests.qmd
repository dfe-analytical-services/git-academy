title: "Pull requests"
---

A [pull request](../glossary.html#pull_request)  allows you to notify your team about changes you've committed and pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add any necessary follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the main branch.

Now you have made changes in your [development branch](making-a-development-branch), we will practice this by merging the changes into your main branch using a pull request.

## Creating pull requests

::: panel-tabset
## Git Bash

1. Ensure you are on the development branch. 

``` bash
git checkout -b <github_username>/development
```

2. Check all your latest changes are pushed to the remote repository. 
``` bash
git push origin <github_username>/development
```
3. Create your pull request, adding a title and a description of your changes 

``` bash
gh pr create --base <github_id>/main --head <github_id>/development --title "Update to log book" --body "Updating logbook to reflect completing the development branch task."
```

## Rstudio and GitHub Website

7. Create Pull Request: Click the "Create pull request" button. Add a title and description for your pull request. You may wish to explain what changes and been made, and why. 

8. You don't need to add any reviewers in this training, but please do take a moment to notice where you can add team mates to review your pull requests in your own work to the right of the description. Any reviewers you add will be notified by email that there is a pull request for them to review.  

9. Once you are happy with your title and description, click 'Create pull request' to confirm.
