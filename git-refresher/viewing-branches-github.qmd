3. A list of all of the branches in the repository which have been synced to the remote will be shown. You can select any branch to view its contents. You can search branches using the search box or just see your own branches by moving to the 'Yours' tab.

## Default Branch
The default branch is like the main version of your project. It's usually called main, but sometimes it might have a different name. This is the branch where the latest, most stable version of your project lives. When you want to make changes to code, you usually create your own branch from main.
