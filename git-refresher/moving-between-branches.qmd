title: "Moving between branches"
---

This section will guide you through switching branches in your repo.

Switching branches is useful for when we might need to pause our work on one branch and continue working on an issue in another branch. Before you switch branches it is important to commit and push the changes in the branch you're currently in. It's also important to pull changes after you switch to your new branch.

## Git Bash

In Git bash, you can switch branches using one of `git check out` or `git switch` followed by the name of the branch you want to switch to.

### Step 1a: Check that you're in your repo's directory

`pwd`

### Step 1b: Navigate to repo's directory

If you're in the correct directory, skip this step. If you're not, navigate to your repo's directory by using the cd command.

`cd path/to/repo/`

### Step 2: Sync local repo with the remote one

This step is for updating your local repo with the changes made to the remote one. This ensures that:

```         
-   you have a full list of remote branches.
-   you have the latest changes in the code to avoid conflicts. 
```

`git pull origin <branch-name>`

### Step 3: Switch branches

`git checkout <github_username>_git-bash_stage_1`

OR

`git switch <github_username>_git-bash_stage_1`

## GitHub Desktop

## VS Code

## RStudio

-   Go to the right hand side of RStudio and click on the Git tab.

-   Click on the downwards arrow to "pull" the latest changes from the remote repo. This ensures that:

    -   you have a full list of remote branches.
    -   you have the latest changes in the code to avoid conflicts.

-   Click on the drop down menu of branches. Usually "main" is the default branch shown before switching.

-   Click on `<github_username>_rstudio_stage_1`

    -   The example in the screenshot below show a branch name specific to another user. You need to click on your own branch.

## PyCharm

-   Click on the branches drop down menu at the top of the screen.

-   Click the Fetch icon to "pull" the latest changes from the remote repo. This ensures that:

    -   you have a full list of remote branches.
    -   you have the latest changes in the code to avoid conflicts.

-   Click on your branch and then click "Checkout".
