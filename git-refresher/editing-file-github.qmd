title: "Editing a file on GitHub"

In this section, we’ll walk through the steps to edit a file on GitHub. We’ll use the example of editing the git-academy-log.md file in the github-sandbox repository. This process can be applied to any file in any repository.

1. Ensure you are still on the GitHub site for the github-sandbox repository. 

2. Check you are on your `<github_username>/main` branch by using the branches drop-down. 

3.  Locate the git-academy-log.md file and click on it as below:

4.  Click the pencil icon (✏️), usually located on the right-hand side, to edit the file.

5. Put an 'X' in each box under 'Exploring a repository' on GitHub.

6.  Find the 'Commit changes' button, normally at the top right of the page.

7.  Enter a commit message describing the changes.

8.  Click 'Commit changes' to save your edits and create a new commit. When you view the git-academy-log file, you should see that the boxes under 'Exploring a repository on Github' are now ticked.
