title: "Syncing to the remote (push)"
---

This section will guide you through syncing your local repo to the remote one, also known as [pushing](../glossary.html#push).

Any change made so far is only being applied to the local copy of the repository (i.e. the copy on your laptop). To apply your changes to the remote repository (i.e. on GitHub or Azure DevOps), you need to **“push”** the changes.

Having [recorded your changes](recording-changes.html), follow the instructions below to push to the remote.

## Git Bash

The first time you update your remote repo with the changes you committed to your local one (aka push the changes), use the command below:

`git push --set-upstream origin <github_username>/main`

After that, if you want to push changes you committed in the same branch use the following command:

`git push`

## RStudio

Click the green upwards arrow to push your changes to the remote repo. You can do this from the commit window as shown in the image below.

### Alternative method

You can also do this from the side panel after closing the commit window as shown in the image below.

Alternatively you can push and commit your changes at the same time from the commit window by clicking "Commit and Push" after you write your commit message.
