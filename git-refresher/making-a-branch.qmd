title: "Making a new branch"
---

In a Git repository, different versions of work are controlled by using what are
called "[branches](https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/azure-devops-for-analysis/version-control-using-git---the-basics.html#making-branches)". Edits can be made to files on a branch and those will not 
effect files on any other branch.

Most repositories will have a "main" branch. This is considered the central 
latest working version of your work. When editing work, we generally don't make 
edits directly on the main branch. Instead we create specific branches for 
specific chunks of work.

Having [cloned the git-academy-sandbox repository](clone-a-repo.html), 
now make a new branch to work in.

## Git Bash

Replace `<github_id>` in the below with your GitHub username to make your own 
personal main branch in the sandbox repository.

``` bash
git checkout -b <github_id>_main
```

## GitHub Desktop

Click **Branch** in the menu bar and then select **New branch...** as shown in 
the screenshot below.

Then enter your branch name as **`<github_id>_main`** (but replacing <github_id> 
with your own GitHub username, e.g. `jsmith_main`)

## VS Code

The current branch (**main**) should be listed in the very bottom left hand 
corner of the VS Code window frame. If you left click on this, you should then 
see a menu appear at the top of the VS Code window with some branch options (as 
shown in the screen shot below).

Click **+ Create new branch...** and then enter your branch name as 
**`<github_id>_main`** (but replacing <github_id> with your own GitHub username, 
e.g. `jsmith_main`).

You should now see the branch name listed in the bottom left of the window frame
shown as the branch you just created, meaning any changes you currently make
will be applied to that new branch (and not main).

## RStudio

In the Git panel, click the purple new branch symbol 
![symbol containing two purple boxes branching from a diamond](images/RStudio-newbranch-button.png) 
as circled in the screenshot below.

Then enter your branch name as **`<github_id>_main`** (but replacing <github_id> 
with your own GitHub username, e.g. `jsmith_main`)

## PyCharm

Open up the Git panel in PyCharm and you should see something like the 
screenshot below. Right click on **main** and select 
**New branch from 'origin/main'...**.

Then enter your branch name as **`<github_id>_main`** (but replacing <github_id> 
with your own GitHub username, e.g. `jsmith_main`).
