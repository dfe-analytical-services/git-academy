title: "Making a new branch"
---

In a Git repository, different versions of work are controlled by using what are
called "[branches](https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/azure-devops-for-analysis/version-control-using-git---the-basics.html#making-branches)". Edits can be made to files on a branch and those will not 
effect files on any other branch.

Most repositories will have a "main" branch. This is considered the central 
latest working version of your work. When editing work, we generally don't make 
edits directly on the main branch. Instead we create specific branches for 
specific chunks of work.

Having [cloned the git-academy-sandbox repository](clone-a-repo.html), 
now make a new branch to work in.

## Git Bash

Replace `<github_id>` in the below with your GitHub username to make your own 
personal main branch in the sandbox repository.

``` bash
git checkout -b <github_id>_main
```

## R-Studio

## PyCharm

Open up the Git panel in PyCharm and you should see something like the 
screenshot below. Right click on **main** and select 
**New branch from 'origin/main'...**.

Then enter your branch name as **`<github_id>_main`** (but replacing <github_id> 
with your own GitHub username, e.g. `jsmith_main`)
