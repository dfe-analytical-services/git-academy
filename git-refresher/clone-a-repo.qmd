title: "Cloning a repository"
---

---
To work on the contents of an existing Git [**repository**](../glossary.html#repository), the first step will often be to [**"clone"**](../glossary.html#clone) it to your local working environment (i.e. your laptop!).

## Getting the clone URL
To clone a repo, you'll first need to find the necessary URL. 

- Go to the [git-academy-sandbox](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/git-academy-sandbox) repository page on GitHub.

- Click the "Code" button and copy the URL (HTTPS link).

## Git Bash

Open the Git Bash terminal and create a folder to store your repos if you haven't already:


``` bash
cd ~/
mkdir repos
cd repos
```

Now clone the repository using the following command (which includes the repository URL you should have copied using the steps earlier in this page) and then change directory (`cd`) into the folder that creates:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/git-academy-sandbox.git
cd git-academy-sandbox
```

After following the above steps, you should now see the current branch name (e.g. main) at the end of the file path as below:

:::: callout-tip
-   Enter `ls` to *list* what files and folders are present in the repo folder.
-   Type `git log` to view recent commits. Press **q** when you are ready to exit the Git log.
-   Type `git status` to check the state of the cloned repository (at this point, it should say everything is up to date, as you haven't made any changes yet).

## RStudio

-   In RStudio, go to **File \> New Project \> Version Control \> Git**.

-   Paste the URL you copied from GitHub into the "Repository URL" field.

-   Choose a directory on your device where you want to save the repo.

-   Click "Create Project".

Check the Files pane in RStudio to see if the repo files have been cloned to your local machine. The files pane normally opens in the right-hand bottom corner of RStudio.
