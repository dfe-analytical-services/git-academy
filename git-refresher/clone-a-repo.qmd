title: "Cloning a repository"
---

---
To work on the contents of an existing Git [**repository**](../glossary.html#repository), the first step will often be to [**"clone"**](../glossary.html#clone) it to your local working environment (i.e. your laptop!).

## Getting the clone URL
To clone a repo, you'll first need to find the necessary URL. 

- Go to the [git-academy-sandbox](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/git-academy-sandbox) repository page on GitHub.

- Click the "Code" button and copy the URL (HTTPS link).

## Git Bash

Navigate to the folder on your device where you want to clone the repo. Right-click in the directory and select **Git Bash Here**.

-   In the Git Bash window that opens, use the \`git clone\` command followed by the URL you copied from GitHub. For this repo, we would enter:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/git-academy-sandbox.git
```

You will need to right-click to paste, as the keyboard shortcut will not work in Git Bash and then press enter.

-   Navigate into the repo by typing `cd git-academy-sandbox` and pressing enter.

-   You should now see the current branch name (e.g. main) at the end of the file path as below:

-   Type `git log` and press enter to view recent commits. Press **q** when you are ready to exit git log.
-   Type `git status` and press enter to check the state of the cloned repository (at this point, it should say everything is up to date, as you haven't made any changes yet).

## RStudio

-   In RStudio, go to **File \> New Project \> Version Control \> Git**.

-   Paste the URL you copied from GitHub into the "Repository URL" field.

-   Choose a directory on your device where you want to save the repo.

-   Click "Create Project".

Check the Files pane in RStudio to see if the repo files have been cloned to your local machine. The files pane normally opens in the right-hand bottom corner of RStudio.
