title: "Recording changes (add, commit and push)"
---

This section will guide you through recording changes you make to your repo through the process of [**adding**](../glossary.html#add), [**staging**](../glossary.html#stage) and [**pushing**](../glossary.html#push) files. 

These steps help you manage and track changes in your project, making collaboration and version control efficient and reliable.

Having [created your own branch](making-a-branch.html), follow the instructions below to make and record changes in your repo.

    OR

    -   To add all changes:
