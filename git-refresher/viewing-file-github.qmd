2. Navigate to the 'code' tab at the top of the page.

3. Find and select the branch you previously created i.e. `<github_id>/main`. You can do this by clicking on the branches button and selecting your branch, or using the branch drop-down as below to click on your branch:

4. Once you have selected your branch, the drop-down will change to show your branch name as below:

5. Click on a file to view the most up-to-date synced code for the branch you have selected.

6. Once you have clicked on a file, you can navigate through different files, change branches or search for a file using Files pane.

7. Each file will have a sub-set of the following views available to select above it: preview, code and blame. You will need to switch to the code view to see and edit the raw contents of the file. The preview view will show you a preview for supported files like Markdown and Quarto and the blame view shows line by line revision history, tracking who made each change and when.
