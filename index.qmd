Welcome to the DfE's Git Academy. This is a collection of interactive tasks you 
can work through to help learn and practice using Git. As this is intended to be
a practical guide, we provide the 
[git-academy-sandbox](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/git-academy-sandbox) 
repository where you can practice using Git in a contained environment.

You can follow through tasks in order or in some cases jump in at specific points 
where you feel you need to target your learning.

:::: {.callout-note}
This isn't aimed at being a comprehensive reference guide. If you need more extensive
reference material for using Git in the DfE, then we recommend looking through
the 
[Azure DevOps for Analysis guide](https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/azure-devops-for-analysis/).
