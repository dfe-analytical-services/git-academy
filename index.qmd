Welcome to the DfE's Git Academy. This is a collection of interactive tasks you 
can work through to help learn and practice using Git. Many use a supporting 
repository called 
[git-academy-sandbox](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services/git-academy-sandbox) 
where you can practice using Git in a contained practice environment.

You should be able to follow through tasks in order to jump in at specific 
jump in points where you feel you need to target your learning.

This isn't aimed at being a comprehensive reference guide however. If you need
reference material for using Git in the DfE, then we recommend looking through
the 
[Azure DevOps for Analysis guide](https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/azure-devops-for-analysis/).
