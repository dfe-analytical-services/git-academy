# Why is Git important?

Git is a software that offers a comprehensive solution for collaborative
work, version control, accountability, disaster recovery, and knowledge
retention. Using Git strengthens QA practices and ensures you're working
in line with [RAP
principles](https://dfe-analytical-services.github.io/analysts-guide/RAP/rap-expectations.html).
Here's why Git holds particular importance for analysts in the civil
service:


<details>
<summary><h2>Collaboration</h2></summary>

Git enables collaboration by allowing team members to work on the same
project simultaneously from any location. It tracks changes made by each
contributor, highlighting 'conflicts', before merging contributions into
one final product. The ability to work on multiple branches
simultaneously saves analysts time (no waiting for colleagues to finish
one part before moving on). Cloud-hosted repositories also enable other
analysts to view your code (with the correct permissions), enabling
knowledge-sharing and transparency. Git's collaborative features and
online repository platforms enable automated checks and QA through pull
requests/peer reviews, supporting compliance with the [code of
practice](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/).

</details>

 
<details>
<summary><h2>Experiment</h2></summary>

Git's 'branching' system creates parallel versions of projects, allowing analysts to experiment, try different
approaches, or add potential new features without fear of breaking
anything on the 'main branch'.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Version control</h2></summary>

Git provides a version control system that keeps a historical record of
all changes made to files in the repository. Analysts can easily revert
to previous versions/past methodologies, compare changes, and identify
the source of any issues. Git best practices (regular commits, useful
branch names and commit messages) ensure that analysts can easily track
and manage changes, allowing them to focus more on analysis and less on
document management.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Audit trails and accountability</h2></summary>

Git's commit history and branching system create an audit trail of every
change made to a project, and who made it. This audit trail helps
analysts demonstrate the evolution of their work, which is essential
when justifying decisions, responding to inquiries, or conducting
internal reviews. The visible history removes uncertainty and again
saves time otherwise spent figuring out what changes others made. Git's
commit messages simplify the process of justifying decisions, responding
to inquiries, and conducting internal reviews, streamlining daily tasks.
This also aids QA as it links closely to the key outcomes of the [DfE QA
framework](https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/sarpi/g/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BCE688250-04F4-41A2-9951-230577A8F129%7D&file=DfE%20Quality%20Assurance%20Framework.docx&action=default&mobileredirect=true)
(i.e. analysis is transparent and accountable).

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Disaster recovery</h2></summary>

Data loss or file corruption can have severe consequences in the civil
service, where data integrity is critical. I'm sure we've all had
tech-disasters where we've lost the files/code scripts we spent the
whole day working on! Git repositories can be hosted on remote servers
or cloud platforms, ensuring that data is safely stored and
backed up. Committing work regularly (every 30 minutes) ensures it never
gets lost, as every commit is recoverable. In DfE we use Azure DevOps
for internal/sensitive repositories and GitHub for public repositories.
This minimizes the risk of data loss due to hardware failures
or other unforeseen events, providing peace of mind for analysts and
their supervisors, knowing that their work is safeguarded against
corruption or unforeseen events.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Skills development</h2></summary>

Git is a widely used tool in the tech industry and beyond in both public
and private sectors. Learning Git not only benefits analysts in their
current roles but also enhances their future career
prospects. As the civil service increasingly incorporates technology and
data-driven approaches, proficiency in Git can open doors to a broader
range of opportunities within and outside the government sector.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h2>Knowledge loss & high turnover</h2></summary>

High-turnover rates and knowledge loss are common challenges in the
civil service. Git's audit trails and commit messages serve as a knowledge
repository, preserving the history of decisions, methodologies, and
changes. When new analysts join the team, this historical context
proves invaluable in supporting their onboarding process and reducing
the knowledge gap.

</details>

In summary, Git is an essential tool for analysts in the civil service
because it facilitates collaborative work, ensures version control,
maintains accountability and audit trails, supports disaster recovery,
and promotes skill development. Embracing Git as part of their toolkit
empowers civil service analysts to work more efficiently, maintain data
integrity, and adapt to the evolving demands of the modern public
sector.
