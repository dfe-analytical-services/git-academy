## Commit

Committing is where you record changes in the Git history. This is one of the most important aspects to understand when using Git. A commit provides a single point in the version control history and when navigating back through the history, you can only navigate to changes that are part of a commit.

## Clone

Cloning a repository is the process of creating a copy of a repository folder system on your local working environment (e.g. your laptop computer).

## Pull

Pulling updates your current local working branch with any changes from the remote branch. You should pull every day that you interact with a repository, at the minimum. 

## Push

Pushing is the process of updating the remote branch with local commits. 

## Repository

A repository (or repo) is effectively a project folder. A given repository would usually contain all the work for a specific project (e.g. a data pipeline, an R-Shiny app, etc).

## Stage

Staging is the process of identifying to Git which files you would like to include in a given [commit](glossary.html#commit).
